# avax-cli-wallet

This repository is under heavy development. It was forked from [slp-cli-wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/slp-cli-wallet) and adapted to work with the AVAX blockchain, using the [slp-avax-bridge](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/slp-avax-bridge) library.
